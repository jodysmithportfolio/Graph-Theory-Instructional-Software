# Work In Progress
# Currently only works in localhost, tested using Webstorm IDE
##Instructions:
- Open "app", open "RedBlack.html" and you will see a red-black tree example, but also with the full suite of Vis.js manipulation and configuration tools available to you. You may click a node to turn it from red to black. This can be used to demonstrate R-B trees to students, and the suite of Vis.js tools allow you to create new graphs right the web-app.

- Open "Traverse.html" to see demonstrations of the Vis.js software applied in the travelling salesman. 
##Notes
- "DOTLang.html" demonstrates how you can create graphs in DOT language (described here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language )
- "JSON.html" is not currently working, a 3 year old plugin is supposed to convert GEPHI to JSON, but there is a physics error that is not mentioned anywhere. May find a workaround in the future
